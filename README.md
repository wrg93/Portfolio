I used basic Bootstrap grids and components for this project. 

Only in a few instances did I need to edit the CSS the directly, predominantly to limit the height on my index.html file.

I attempted to integrate php and JQuery in order to add functionality to the submit button on the contact page but found that this was as of yet over my head so I commented it out. I look forward to implimenting this later!
