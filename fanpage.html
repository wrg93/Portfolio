    <h1>Muse Tribute Page!</h1>

    <p>
      Muse are an English progress rock band formed in 1994. Inaugural acclaimation centered around their vivacious live performances. This enthusiasm was further flamed by the massive success of their second studio album "Orgin of Symmetry". Their innovative combination of classical and grunge spoke loudly to a predominantly European fanbase.

      <br />
      Global success came to the band when their single "Super Massive Blackhole" was prominantly featured in the film "Twilight". Since then American audiences too have been enamored with the trio and the ecclectic anthem rock they produce.
